title: "A heuristic function for improving the prediction accuracy of fault revealing mutants"

---

We propose a method that employs a heuristic function to create an artificial view of the training data set; then, it trains two classifiers, one with the original view and one with the artificial view. Finally, it combines the opinions of trained models to predict fault-revealing mutants.
