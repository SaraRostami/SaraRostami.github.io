As a research assistant and master’s student, my focus centers on exploring the impact of predictive coding theory on neural activity and representations in the brain. Guided by [Dr.Mohammadreza Abolghasemi Dehaqani](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~dehaqani), my master’s thesis addresses the question: How do neural adaptation and expectation contribute to the representation of complex visual stimuli in frontotemporal circuits?
