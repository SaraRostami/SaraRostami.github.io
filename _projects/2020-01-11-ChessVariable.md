ChessVariable is a website created by me for the purpose of automatic money transaction management for chess tournaments hosted by [lichess](https://lichess.org/).

## Problem definition
<p align="justify"> Lichess is a well-known website among chess players, in which players can play chess friendly or in tournaments. However, Lichess does not provide a money transaction and tournament management system, making it on-handy, especially for tournament organizers to establish and manage tournaments. </p>

## What we did
<p align="justify">In this regard, we analyzed the requirements that Iranian chess tournament organizers and players are faced in Lichess tournaments and proposed a website named ChessVariable specifically for the Iranian chess community. ChessVariable internally uses Lichess APIs and Iranian banks APIs, but this website is not a simple APIs consumer. It provides a wallet, magical codes and many other facilities to fulfil the needs of the chess community in an integrated environment. In ChessVariable, people can create a Lichess tournament, specify rules, admission fees and awards, monitor the tournament, etc., with an automatic money transaction system.</p>
