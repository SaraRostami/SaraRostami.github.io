This is a simple web scrapper program for scrapping Tripadvisor and collecting data for data analysis purposes.

## Problem definition
<p align="justify"><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/">Tripadvisor</a> is a well-known website where people can share their experiences and thoughts about various travelling-related topics. My friend <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GqH9-rsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Sadaf Rabiee Mary</a> needed to access some data from Tripadvisor. So, she asked me to write a program to extract the needed data.</p>


## What we did

<p align="justify">I wrote a program using a python package named BeautifulSoup, which extracts the required data. Unfortunately, Tripadvisor prohibited using their data for research purposes. Therefore, we followed their obligations and didn't continue that research. Nevertheless, I made the code publicly available because it might be beneficial for others searching for a simple way to extract data from websites other than Tripadvisor.</p>
