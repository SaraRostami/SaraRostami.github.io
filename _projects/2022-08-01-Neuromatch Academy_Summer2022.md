title: "Computational Neuroscience (Neuromatch Academy) - Summer 2022"
---

I was a student at the [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/) for the Computational Neuroscience summer program. during this program we did [tutorials](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) and also a group project on the HCB 2021 fmri dataset.

## Problem definition
<p align="justify">We worked on the data from the gambling task of the HCB dataset.<p>Question: How does the neural response to emotion cues correlate with the neural responses to reward and punishment?</p>
<p> Hypthesis: Brain areas more active during emotion cognition would also show higher activity on receiving reward and/or punishment feedback.</p>


## What we did
<p align="justify">We calculated individual-level RDMs and performed RSA analysis to compare the brain activation patterns during win and loss trials. for the group-level analysis, we used the Random Forest classifier.</p>
