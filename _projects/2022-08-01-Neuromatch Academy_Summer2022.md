title: "Computational Neuroscience (Neuromatch Academy) - Summer 2022"
---

I was a student at the [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/) for the Computational Neuroscience summer program. during this program we did [tutorials](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) and also a group project on the [HCB 2021 fmri dataset](https://www.humanconnectome.org/). For successfuly compeleting the course, I recieved a [certificate](https://github.com/SaraRostami/IndependentCodingVentures/blob/c1bc8809b3490ccfb022f2c099091c930b961583/NeuromatchAcademy_Summer2022/NMA_Student_summer2022.pdf).

## Problem definition
We worked on the data from the gambling task of the HCB dataset.<p>**Question:** How does the neural response to emotion cues correlate with the neural responses to reward and punishment?</p><p>**Hypothesis:** Brain areas more active during emotion cognition would also show higher activity on receiving reward and/or punishment feedback.</p>

## What we did
We calculated individual-level RDMs and performed RSA analysis to compare the brain activation patterns during win and loss trials. for the group-level analysis, we used the Random Forest classifier.
