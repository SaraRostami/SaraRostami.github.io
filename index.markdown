# About Me

I just graduated from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) with a degree in artificial intelligence and robotics. I'm an aspiring neuroscience enthusiast with an insatiable curiosity for understanding the intricacies of the human mind.
I received my B.Sc. in Computer engineering from [Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Mazandaran](https://nit.ac.ir/en).
For my undergraduate project I worked with EEG signals to recognize emotions using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

I've always been curious about how our minds work. Why are we good at some things but struggle with others? Can we get better at what we're good at and improve what we're not so good at?
I'm strongly confident that neuroscience has the capability to offer insights into these questions over time. It begins with understanding how the brain operates for distinct tasks, and gradually, we can develop the skill to cleverly influence the brain's basic functions using well-thought-out interventions, wheteher it be through specalized mind exercises or techniques such as brain stimulation, neurofeedback, etc.

I hope to learn more about the brain and also help people in some way along the way. I recently defended my master's thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Mohammadreza Abolghasemi Dehaqani](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~dehaqani). In my thesis, we attempted to investigate the brain's automatic change detection ability using a well-known neural signature called Visual Mismatch Negativity (vMMN).

Specifically, we investigated this Event-Related Potential (ERP) component based on the predictive coding hypothesis. We aimed to dissociate the repetition-related and expectation-related effects contributing to vMMN by designing a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) task paradigm and recording EEG signals from subjects.

Our task was based on the study by [Summerfield et al. (2008)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2163), with minor differences. The most significant modification was the use of complex visual stimuli. By adopting this approach, we were able to address a gap in previous work by separately investigating repetition and expectation, and also gain new insights about the brain's processing of complex visual stimuli, rather than simple ones.
