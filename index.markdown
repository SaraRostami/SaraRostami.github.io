# About Me

I just graduated from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) with a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. I’m an aspiring neuroscience enthusiast with an insatiable curiosity for understanding the intricacies of the human mind.  
I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Mazandaran](https://nit.ac.ir/en). For my undergraduate project, I worked with EEG signals to recognize emotions using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

I’ve always been curious about how our minds work. Why are we good at some things but struggle with others? Can we get better at what we’re good at and improve what we’re not so good at?  
I’m strongly confident that neuroscience has the capability to offer insights into these questions over time. By studying how the brain supports specific cognitive functions, researchers are beginning to identify patterns of neural activity associated with different mental tasks. Over time, this knowledge may enable us to refine brain function through targeted interventions—ranging from cognitive training programs to techniques like non-invasive brain stimulation and neurofeedback—grounded in empirical evidence and neurobiological mechanisms.

I recently defended my master’s thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Mohammadreza Abolghasemi Dehaqani](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~dehaqani) at the University of Tehran. In my thesis, we investigated the brain’s automatic change detection ability using a well-known neural signature called Visual Mismatch Negativity (vMMN).  
Specifically, we explored this Event-Related Potential (ERP) component within the framework of the predictive coding hypothesis, aiming to disentangle repetition-related and expectation-related effects contributing to vMMN. Our Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm, inspired by [Summerfield et al. (2008)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2163), incorporated complex visual stimuli to better understand how the brain processes and predicts visual information in more realistic contexts.

Currently, I’m pursuing my **Master’s in Neuroscience** at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/) in the [Mohsenzadeh Lab](https://mohsenzadehlab.ca/), under the supervision of [Dr. Yalda Mohsenzadeh](https://www.eng.uwo.ca/electrical/faculty/mohsenzadeh_y.html) and [Dr. Emma Duerden](https://www.edu.uwo.ca/faculty-profiles/duerden_emma.html).  
My current research focuses on investigating **visual processing in the human brain using simultaneous EEG–fNIRS recording**. By integrating these complementary neuroimaging modalities, I aim to capture both the temporal dynamics and hemodynamic responses associated with visual perception—advancing our understanding of how the brain integrates information across time and modality.

Most recently, I’ve been gravitating toward neuro-inspired computational models, particularly frameworks that draw from biological principles such as predictive coding, attractor dynamics, and neuromodulation. I’m interested in how these ideas can contribute not only to more interpretable and adaptable AI architectures but also to addressing some of the pressing challenges in current AI systems—such as robustness, continual learning, and generalization.  
By grounding machine learning models in the computational principles of the brain, I hope to contribute to the development of next-generation AI systems that are both cognitively informed and practically impactful.
