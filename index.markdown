# Biography

I'm a graduate student at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), majoring in artificial intelligence and robotics.
I received my B.Sc. in Computer engineering at [Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Mazandaran](https://www.modares.ac.ir/en/aboutus).
for my undergraduate project I worked with eeg signals to recognize emotions using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

I have always been curious about the human mind. why we like things that we like, why some of us are good at something while some of us aren't,
and how can we change that. and ever since I've become aware of brain's plasticity, I've been more and more curious about what the human mind can do.
I hope to learn more about the human brain and also help people in some way along the way.
Currently I'm in the midst of writing my proposal under the supervision of [Dr. Mohammadreza Abolghasemi Dehaqani](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~dehaqani).
